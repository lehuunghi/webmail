 * for good if the request fails: a sign-in form with no name on it would be
 * worse than one with the wrong name.

 *
 * Two shapes for the same fact: the hook for components, and the plain
 * function for the few places that build strings outside React (the service
 * worker's facts, for one). Both fall back to the default until the session

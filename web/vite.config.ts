 * index.html when the bundle is built, so a build that does not know its prefix
 * emits `/assets/...` and the shell 404s under `/mail/`. So `BASE_PATH` is read
 * at build time here as well as at run time in the server, and the Dockerfile
 * carries one value into both.
 *
 * Vite wants the directory form with the trailing slash, and hands it back to
 * the app as `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` -- which is where `lib/basePath.ts`
 * gets it, so the browser never has to be told separately.

 * went back to the server. With the whole list in the page, the worker can
 * fetch them in the background once a new version is seen, and knows to keep
 * them. Language catalogs are listed apart: a reader wants one of them, which
 * is cached when it is first loaded.
 *
 * An inert JSON block rather than prefetch links, which the browser would
 * fetch on every load.
